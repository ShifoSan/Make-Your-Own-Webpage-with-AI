ðŸš€ Task 4 of 4: The Business & Content Footer
To: Jules (Production Coder)
From: Gemini (Technical Partner)
Project: visionary-io
Task: 4 of 4 - The Business & Content Footer
Jules, this is the final task. We will complete the webpage by adding all the business information, FAQs, and contact details. This task transitions from 3D-heavy overlays to standard HTML content sections.
1. Implement Scene 6: The Blueprint (About, Process, Vision)
 * HTML Trigger: Create a new <section> with standard height (not vh). This is a normal content section.
 * 3D Scene (Transition):
   * The "Client Gallery" 3D scene must fade out.
   * The "Builder" orb animates to a final resting position (e.g., top-left corner of the viewport) where it will just hover and pulse softly. It is now a persistent background element, no longer the main focus.
 * HTML Content (Standard, non-overlaid HTML):
   * Sub-section 1: "About Me"
     * Headline: "One Creator. Limitless Potential."
     * Body: "My name is ShifoSan, and this is my one-person studio..." (full text from original prompt).
   * Sub-section 2: "Our Process"
     * Headline: "From Your Mind to a Live Site in 3 Steps"
     * Body (as a 3-step graphic/list): 1. Vision, 2. Creation, 3. Delivery (full text from original prompt).
   * Sub-section 3: "Our Vision"
     * Headline: "World-class design shouldn't be a barrier."
     * Body: "We believe a stunning, professional webpage shouldn't be locked behind complex code..." (full text from original prompt).
2. Implement Scene 7: The Details (Capabilities, FAQs, & Contact)
 * HTML Trigger: Create the final content <section> at the bottom of the page.
 * 3D Scene: The "Builder" orb continues to hover in its persistent position.
 * HTML Content:
   * Sub-section 1: "Our Capabilities & Limitations"
     * Headline: "Our Focus: What We Do (and Don't) Do"
     * Body: "We are 100% transparent... This means we cannot build complex back-end systems..." (full text from original prompt).
   * Sub-section 2: "Frequently Asked Questions"
     * Task: You must look for the file public/FAQs.txt in the repository.
     * Action: Fetch and parse this file. It is formatted as Q&A pairs.
     * Component: Build a clean, animated accordion/dropdown component. The answer must slide down smoothly (animating max-height) with a subtle fade-in.
   * Sub-section 3: "Community & Contact"
     * Headline: "Let's Build Your Masterpiece"
     * Main CTA Button: Create a prominent button labeled "Start Your Project".
     * Action: Link this button to https://forms.gle/NQE389HgZb5aFH2P8 (open in a new tab).
     * Contact Links (Footer):
       * Email: shifosan.official@gmail.com
       * X (Twitter): @ShifoSan
       * Discord: [Join our Discord Community] (as placeholder text).
This final task is complete when all HTML content is correctly formatted, the orb is in its final state, and the FAQ accordion correctly fetches and displays the FAQs.txt content.
