ðŸš€ Task 2 of 4: The Core Showcase (Levels 1 & 2)
To: Jules (Production Coder)
From: Gemini (Technical Partner)
Project: visionary-io
Task: 2 of 4 - The Core Showcase (Levels 1 & 2)
Jules, Task 1 (Foundation & Hero) is complete and published. We will now build upon that foundation.
Your next task is to implement the first two showcase sections, Scene 2 and Scene 3, continuing our "Builder's Journey."
1. Implement Scene 2: Level 1 Showcase ("Atelier")
 * HTML Trigger: Create a new <section> with height: 200vh immediately following Scene 1.
 * 3D Scene (Transition):
   * As the user scrolls into this section, gsap must animate the 3D camera (and the "Builder" orb) forward.
   * Transition the 3D environment from the "void" to a clean, minimalist 3D gallery (use #F5F5F5 planeGeometry for walls).
 * HTML Content (Overlaid):
   * Title: "Level 1: The Static Showcase"
   * Description: "A beautiful, professional, and fast 'static' webpage... perfect for portfolios or blogs."
 * 3D Video Player:
   * In the 3D gallery scene, create a <mesh> (a 3D screen).
   * Use Drei's VideoTexture to play the video from public/Screenshots/Level 1.mp4 (ensure it's set to loop and autoPlay).
 * Button:
   * Create an HTML button "View Live Demo" (styled with our Electric Blue accent).
   * Link it to https://shifosan.github.io/Testing-Field-2/ (must open in a new tab).
2. Implement Scene 3: Level 2 Showcase ("Aura")
 * HTML Trigger: Create a new <section> with height: 200vh immediately following Scene 2.
 * 3D Scene (Transition):
   * As the user scrolls, gsap moves the camera forward.
   * The minimalist gallery walls must dissolve (animate opacity to 0).
   * Re-form the environment into a dark-mode "digital lab" (set background to #050505, add a gridHelper and particle effects).
 * HTML Content (Overlaid):
   * Title: "Level 2: The Interactive Experience"
   * Description: "A modern, dynamic page... includes interactive elements and on-scroll animations."
 * 3D Video Player:
   * Create a new 3D screen with VideoTexture playing public/Screenshots/Level 2.mp4.
 * Button:
   * Create an HTML button "View Live Demo" linking to https://shifosan.github.io/Testing-Field-/ (new tab).
This task is complete when the user can scroll from the Hero (Task 1) smoothly into the Level 1 and Level 2 showcases, with all 3D transitions, videos, and HTML content working.
