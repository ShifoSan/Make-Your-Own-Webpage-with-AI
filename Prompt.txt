Jules, this is the final and most important build. We are creating the official business webpage for "Make your own Webpage with AI." This page must be the product—a high-end, cinematic "Level 3+" scrollytelling experience that showcases all three of our service levels and establishes the brand.
The concept is "The Builder's Journey." The user will be guided by a 3D "Builder" orb through a continuous 3D space, witnessing our capabilities before landing on the clear business details.
This is our most ambitious project. Adhere to the tech stack and execute the 7-Scene flow precisely.
1. Core Tech Stack
 * Framework: React.js (Create React App or Vite)
 * 3D Environment: React Three Fiber (@react-three/fiber)
 * 3D Helpers/Assets: Drei (@react-three/drei)
 * Animation/Scrollytelling: GSAP (specifically ScrollTrigger)
 * Styling: styled-components or Emotion for CSS-in-JS.
 * State Management: Zustand (lightweight, for managing scroll state/scene transitions).
2. High-Level Architecture (Hybrid Model)
Do not build this as one giant, 10,000-pixel-high 3D canvas. We will use a "hybrid" approach for performance and accessibility:
 * 3D Canvas (<CanvasComponent />): This component will be position: fixed, top: 0, left: 0, z-index: -1. It will contain our entire Three.js scene (the orb, the environments, the 3D models).
 * HTML Content (<ContentComponent />): This will be the standard, scrollable DOM element. It will be a series of "trigger" sections (e.g., <section style={{ height: '200vh' }}>).
 * Synchronization: GSAP ScrollTrigger will be the "conductor." It will watch the scroll position of the HTML content and use it to animate the Three.js camera, the "Builder" orb, and all 3D scene transitions.
This hybrid model gives us the best of both worlds: a cinematic 3D background and clean, accessible, and easily-styled HTML content.
3. The 7-Scene Scrollytelling Flow
Here is the complete plan, scene by scene.
Scene 1: The Genesis (Hero Section)
 * HTML Trigger: A <section> with height: 150vh.
 * 3D Scene: A dark, cinematic void.
 * Action (On Scroll):
   * Use Drei <Points> or a custom shader to create a particle cloud.
   * As the user scrolls, GSAP animates these particles to converge and form our "Builder" orb (a stylized, glowing sphereGeometry).
 * HTML Content (Overlaid):
   * H1: "Your Vision. Our AI. Your Webpage." (Animate in with GSAP).
   * Sub-title: "A ShifoSan Creation" (Animate in after the H1).
Scene 2: Level 1 Showcase ("Atelier")
 * HTML Trigger: A new <section> with height: 200vh.
 * 3D Scene (Transition):
   * GSAP moves the camera (and the "Builder" orb) forward.
   * The "void" environment transitions into a clean, minimalist 3D gallery (use simple planeGeometry for walls).
 * HTML Content (Overlaid):
   * Title: "Level 1: The Static Showcase"
   * Description: "A beautiful, professional, and fast 'static' webpage... perfect for portfolios or blogs."
   * 3D Video Player: In the 3D scene, create a <mesh> (a 3D screen). Use Drei's VideoTexture to play the video from Screenshots/Level 1.mp4 (set to loop and autoPlay).
   * Button: Create an HTML button "View Live Demo" that links to https://shifosan.github.io/Testing-Field-2/ (open in a new tab).
Scene 3: Level 2 Showcase ("Aura")
 * HTML Trigger: A new <section> with height: 200vh.
 * 3D Scene (Transition):
   * GSAP moves the camera.
   * The minimalist gallery walls dissolve, and the environment re-forms into a dark-mode "digital lab" (use gridHelper and particle effects).
 * HTML Content (Overlaid):
   * Title: "Level 2: The Interactive Experience"
   * Description: "A modern, dynamic page... includes interactive elements and on-scroll animations."
   * 3D Video Player: A new 3D screen with VideoTexture playing Screenshots/Level 2.mp4.
   * Button: HTML button "View Live Demo" linking to https://shifosan.github.io/Testing-Field-/ (new tab).
Scene 4: Level 3 Showcase ("Vortex")
 * HTML Trigger: A new <section> with height: 200vh.
 * 3D Scene (Transition):
   * This is the "wow" moment. Animate the camera to fly through the Level 2 3D screen, which shatters into particles (use a custom shader or Drei Explode).
   * We are now in a full 3D "vortex" space (use a particle tunnel or shader).
 * HTML Content (Overlaid):
   * Title: "Level 3: The Immersive Journey"
   * Description: "Our premium, 'wow-factor' experience... cinematic 3D models and 'scrollytelling'."
   * 3D Video Player: A 3D screen playing Screenshots/Level 3.mp4 within the vortex.
   * Button: HTML button "View Live Demo" linking to https://shifosan.github.io/Testing-Field-3/ (new tab).
Scene 5: Our Work (Client Portfolio)
 * HTML Trigger: A new <section> with height: 200vh.
 * 3D Scene (Transition):
   * The vortex calms down and transitions into a clean, professional "Client Gallery."
 * HTML Content (Overlaid):
   * Title: "Our Client Showcase"
   * Project 1 Title: "The Paradis Legion"
   * 3D Video Player: A 3D screen playing Screenshots/Official - The Paradis Legion.mp4.
   * Button: HTML button "View Live Site" linking to https://shifosan.github.io/THE-PARADIS-LEGION-/ (new tab).
Scene 6: The Blueprint (About, Process, Vision)
 * HTML Trigger: A new <section> with standard height (not vh). This is a content section.
 * 3D Scene (Transition):
   * The "Client Gallery" fades out.
   * The "Builder" orb moves to the side of the screen (e.g., top-left) and just hovers and pulses softly. It is now a persistent background element, no longer the main focus.
 * HTML Content (This is now standard HTML, not an overlay):
   * Sub-section 1: "About Me"
     * Headline: "One Creator. Limitless Potential."
     * Body: "My name is ShifoSan, and this is my one-person studio. I am the sole creator, designer, and architect for every project. By partnering with a powerful suite of advanced AI tools—like my technical partner (Gemini) and my AI coder (Jules)—I can translate your vision into a high-end, custom-coded webpage at a speed and quality that's simply not possible with traditional agencies."
   * Sub-section 2: "Our Process"
     * Headline: "From Your Mind to a Live Site in 3 Steps"
     * Body (as a 3-step graphic/list):
       * Vision: You provide the idea, your goals, and your content (text and images).
       * Creation: I personally build your site using my AI-driven workflow, translating your vision into code and sending you the first version for review.
       * Delivery: After our two rounds of revisions, I deliver the final, polished code files. You own it, 100%.
   * Sub-section 3: "Our Vision"
     * Headline: "World-class design shouldn't be a barrier."
     * Body: "We believe a stunning, professional webpage shouldn't be locked behind complex code or thousand-dollar budgets. My mission is to empower creators, solo-founders, and small businesses with the high-end, 'wow-factor' web presence they deserve. We build the barrier-breakers."
Scene 7: The Details (Capabilities, FAQs, & Contact)
 * HTML Trigger: The final content <section> at the bottom of the page.
 * 3D Scene: The "Builder" orb continues to hover in the background.
 * HTML Content:
   * Sub-section 1: "Our Capabilities & Limitations"
     * Headline: "Our Focus: What We Do (and Don't) Do"
     * Body: "We are 100% transparent about our services. We specialize in stunning front-end (the visual part of the website). This means we cannot build complex back-end systems like:
       * User login systems or member-only areas
       * E-commerce stores with payment processing
       * User databases or social media platforms
       * Any feature that requires a server to store user data
     * If your request is outside this scope, we will notify you immediately."
   * Sub-section 2: "Frequently AskedQuestions"
     * Task: You must look for a file named FAQs.txt or FAQs.md in the root of the repository.
     * Action: Fetch and parse this file. It is formatted as Q&A pairs.
     * Component: Build a clean, animated accordion/dropdown component that displays each Q&A pair.
   * Sub-section 3: "Community & Contact"
     * Headline: "Let's Build Your Masterpiece"
     * Main CTA Button: Create a prominent button labeled "Start Your Project".
     * Action: Link this button to https://forms.gle/NQE389HgZb5aFH2P8 and ensure it opens in a new tab.
     * Contact Links (Footer):
       * Email: shifosan.official@gmail.com
       * X (Twitter): @ShifoSan
       * Discord: [Join our Discord Community] (Use this as placeholder text for a link ShifoSan will add later).
Jules, this is the blueprint. The user's experience must be seamless. Focus on fluid GSAP transitions, optimized 3D assets, and a premium, responsive HTML layout for the final content sections. Let's make this our new standard.
